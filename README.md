Life Achievements Tracker
-------------------------

Mobile app for tracking life achievements.

Simple & minimal.

## Motivation
In times of a depressed mood we tend to forget and disregard what we have accomplished in our lives.

We see our lives as miserable ones.

Writing down our achievements, even the smallest ones, switches the mind focus to a more positive thinking.

At any time you can open your life achievements tracker and see how much you've accomplished in your life!

## Technology
